Reclaim Protocol Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Reclaim Protocol (the "Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") clarifies the terms under which intellectual property is contributed to the Project. This Agreement protects you as a Contributor as well as Reclaim Protocol and its users.

**Background:**

Most of users’ reputation is locked up in apps’ walled gardens. They cannot bring their reputation with them when they come to your app. The number of viral tiktok videos you’ve made is stuck on tiktok, the amount of sales you’ve done on shopify is stuck on shopify.

Using Reclaim, when a user sees some data on their browser, they can generate a cryptographic proof for it. They can then export their reputation verifiably. They can generate a proof of the amount of sales they’ve done on Shopify to get access to a loan.
