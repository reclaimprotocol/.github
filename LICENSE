b) All references to "CreatorOS Inc" or "the Licensor" in this agreement will automatically be interpreted to refer to the DAO once the transition is complete.

c) License fees will be payable to the DAO's treasury using methods determined by the DAO.

d) The transition date and the DAO's operational details will be announced on the project's official website and communication channels.

e) Existing licensees will be given a reasonable timeframe to transition to the new licensing authority.

This clause is irrevocable and binding on all parties, including the current licensor.

## License Evolution

a) Be made in good faith to maintain the spirit of the original agreement
b) Not retroactively invalidate existing licenses
c) Provide a reasonable grace period for compliance with new terms
d) Be communicated clearly through official project channels

## Transition Notification
